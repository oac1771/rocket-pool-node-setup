    - setup alerting with grafana
        - look into saving container logs on grafana 
        - alert for no peers
    - update tailscale
        - look into firewall rules
            - https://tailscale.com/kb/1077/secure-server-ubuntu-18-04#step-6-restrict-all-other-traffic
            - test turning tailscale off and seeing if we lose peers 
    - use new client for eth1 (fuck besu)
